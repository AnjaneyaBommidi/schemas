title: Special Folder
description: |-
  The Postman Collection Format defines a few special top-level folders that have explicit purposes:

  - examples:
    This folder is for requests that are meant to be examples of how to use your API. They will usually
    contain sample data, populated headers, and often even saved responses.  These requests usually
    don't have any scripts.

  - tests:
    This folder is for requests that are meant to test specific functionality of your API.  This can
    include end-to-end tests, smoke tests, uptime monitoring, etc.  It's very common for these tests
    to contain scripts and use variables to store state between requests.  It's also very common for
    this folder to contain many sub-folders for different test runs.  When using the Newman command-line
    tool, you can choose to run a specific sub-folder within this folder.

  - requests:
    This is a catch-all folder for any type of request, or for requests that don't belong in one
    of the other folders.  For example, this is a good place to save requests that you use frequently
    during debugging or development of your API.
