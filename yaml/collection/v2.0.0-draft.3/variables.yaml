title: Variables
description: >-
  Using variables in your Postman requests eliminates the need to duplicate requests,
  which can save a lot of time. Variables can be referenced anywhere in a request.

  Variables defined at the top-level of a collection can be overridden by variables defined at
  lower levels of the collection, such as in an Endpoint or in a Request.

  Collection Variables can be overridden by Environment Variables in Postman and Newman.

  # These properties can contain ANY characters, including spaces and special characters, as long
  # as the first character is an underscore
