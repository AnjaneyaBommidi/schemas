  Each key of this object is a cookie name,  and each value is the cookie's properties,
  including its value, its expiration date, etc.  Any part of a cookie can contain variables in
  double curly brackets (e.g. `{{Cookie_Name}}`)

      This is a shorthand notation for setting a cookie's value and accepting the default
      values for all other properties (as defined by RFC 6265)

      secure:

          Directs browsers to only transmit the cookie over secure/encrypted connections
      httpOnly:

        description: >-
          Directs browsers to only expose the cookie through HTTP (and HTTPS) requests.
          Cookies with this attribute are not accessible via non-HTTP methods, such as JavaScript
          (using `document.cookie`), and therefore cannot be easily stolen via cross-site scripting
      expires:
        $ref: types.yaml#/definitions/Date
        description: >-
          The date that the cookie expires. We recommend that you use ISO-8601 format
          (e.g. `2015-11-26T00:16:38.000Z`).  Postman will automatically convert it
          to RFC 1123 format (e.g. `Sun, 26 Nov 2015 00:16:38 GMT`)
