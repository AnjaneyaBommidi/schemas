# Yes, this is a VERY empty collection.
# The only thing that's actually required is the collection name.
#
# Collections fill different needs for different people, so which properties you choose to add to your
# collection depends on its purpose.  If you just want to define your API schema, then set the "schema" property.
# If you just want a place to store HTTP requests, then set the "requests" property.  If your using
# the collection as a suite of tests to run via Newman, then set the "tests" property.
#
# Of course, you may also choose to use one collection for ALL of the above (plus more!), in which
# case you will end up setting several different properties.  Postman and Newman are smart enough to
# know which parts of the collection are for which purposes, so you don't need to worry about your
# "examples" requests accidentally getting run as part of your test suite.
