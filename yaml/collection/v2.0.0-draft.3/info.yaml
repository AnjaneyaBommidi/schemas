    description: >
      Every collection is identified by the unique value of this field. The value
      of this field is usually easiest to generate using a UID generator
      function. If you already have a collection, it is recommended that you
      maintain the same id since changing the id usually implies that is
      a different collection than it was originally.

       *Note: This field exists for compatibility reasons with Collection Format V1.*
