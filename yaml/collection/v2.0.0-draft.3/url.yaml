      The URL string can contain variables using double curly brackets.
      (e.g. `http://{{server}}:{{port_number}}/users/login`)

  UrlObject:
    type: object
    description: >
      The URL object has separate properties for each part of the URL.
      The property names are the same as in Node.js and the HTML DOM (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location),
      but some of the property types have been expanded from simple strings to more complex types
      to allow for advanced features of Postman, such as variables.

          (e.g. `/api/{{version_number}}/users/login` or `["api", "{{version_number}}", "users", "login"]`).
