  ResourcePath:
    description: >-
      The resource path can be specified as a string or as an array of path segments.
      Either format allows the path to contain parameters, but only the array allows you to specify
      the JSON Schema for the parameters.
    oneOf:
      - $ref: "#/definitions/ResourcePathString"
      - $ref: "#/definitions/ResourcePathSegments"

  ResourcePathString:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    description: >-
      Specifies the REST Resource's path as a string.  The string can contain parameters in double
      curly brackets (e.g. `/products/{{category}}/{{product_id}}/details`).  Postman will treat each
      parameter as a string.

  ResourcePathSegments:
    type: array
    minItems: 1
    items:
      oneOf:
        - $ref: "#/definitions/ResourcePathSegment"
        - $ref: "#/definitions/ResourcePathParameter"

  ResourcePathSegment:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    description: >-
      A fixed path segment (i.e. not a parameter).  For example, in the path
      `/products/{{category}}/{{product_id}}/details`, there are two string segments:
      "products" and "details".

  ResourcePathParameter:
    $ref: json-schema.yaml
    description: >-
      A parameter segment.  For example, in the path `/products/{{category}}/{{product_id}}/details`,
      there are two parameter segments named "category" and "product_id".
