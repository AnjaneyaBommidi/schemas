# Postman Collections are parsed as YAML, which is a superset of JSON.
# Any valid JSON file is ALSO a valid YAML file, so you can use whichever format you prefer.
# Because JSON files will be parsed as YAML, you can also include comments in your JSON files.
# Just be sure you use the "#" character for comments, rather than "//" or "/* */".
